python-aliyun
=============

Python API wrapper for the Aliyun cloud

[http://python-aliyun.readthedocs.org](http://python-aliyun.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

Installing
----------

You should build a [virtualenv][virtualenv] to contain this project's Python dependencies. The Makefile will create one for you and put it in `~/.virtualenvs/python-aliyun`.
```
git clone git@github.com:quixey/python-aliyun.git
cd python-aliyun
sudo pip install virtualenv
make virtualenv
source ~/.virtualenvs/python-aliyun/bin/activate
```

Aliyun API
----------

The Aliyun API is well-documented at [dev.aliyun.com](http://dev.aliyun.com/thread.php?spm=0.0.0.0.MqTmNj&fid=8).
Each service's API is very similar: There are regions, actions, and each action has many parameters.
It is an OAuth2 API, so you need to have an ID and a secret. You can get these from the Aliyun management console.

Authentication
--------------

You will need security credentials for your Aliyun account. You can view and
create them in the [Aliyun management console](http://console.aliyun.com). This
library will look for credentials in the following places:

 1. Environment variables `ALI_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `ALI_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
 1. An ini-style configuration file at ~/.aliyun.cfg with contents like:
```
[default]
access_key_id=xxxxxxxxxxxxx
secret_access_key=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
 3. A system-wide version of that file at /etc/aliyun.cfg with similar contents.

We recommend using environment variables whenever possible.

Main Interfaces
---------------

The main components of python-aliyun are ECS and SLB. Other Aliyun products will
be added as API support develops. Within each Aliyun product, we tried to
implement every API Action variation available. We used a boto-style design
where most API interaction is done with a connection object which marshalls
Python objects and API representations.

ECS
---

You can create a new ECS connection and interact with ECS like this:
```python
import aliyun.ecs.connection
conn = aliyun.ecs.connection.EcsConnection('cn-hangzhou')
print conn.get_all_instance_ids()
```

This module makes use of one as-yet undocumented API Action: ModifyInstanceSpec.

This module does not implement the following API Action: ResetDisk.

SLB
---

Similarly for SLB, get the connection object like this:
```python
import aliyun.slb.connection
conn = aliyun.slb.connection.SlbConnection('cn-hangzhou')
print conn.get_all_load_balancer_ids()
```

ali command
-----------

The ali commandline tool is mostly used for debugging the Aliyun API interactions.
It accepts arbitrary Key=Value pairs and passes them on to the API after wrapping them.

```shell
ali --region cn-hangzhou ecs Action=DescribeRegions
ali --region cn-hangzhou slb Action=DescribeLoadBalancers
```
